# Reinforcement learning scratchbook

This repository contains notes and implementations of select algorithms as covered in Reinforcement learning an introduction (Sutton & Barto, 2018). Not all programming exercises are solved + some extra exercises are made that are not explicitly stated in the book.

Considering this is a scratch book I cannot guarantee the algorithms are implemented as cleanly as they could've been, however the results are most likely correct.

## Implemented environments:

* Gridworld 
* Car rental environment (infinite horizon, model-free)
* Gambler's game (model-free and model-based)

## Implemented algorithms

* Various bandits
* Dynamic programming
* First-visit monte carlo (on/off policy)
* Temporal difference learning: on-policy (SARSA) / off-policy (Q-learning)

Planned to be done by 20/03:
Implementation of a (subset) of:
* ~~Off-policy variant of Monte-Carlo using importance sampling~~
* ~~Temporal-difference learning~~
  * Sarsa
  * Q-learning
*  Actor-critic methods
* DQN
* Policy-gradient methods
* â€¦
